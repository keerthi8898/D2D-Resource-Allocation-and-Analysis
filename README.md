# D2D Resource Allocation and Analysis

## Overview  
This repository contains the implementation of **Bipartite Graph-Based Proportional Fair Resource Allocation for D2D Communication** based on the paper:  

**[1]** ‚ÄúBipartite Graph Based Proportional Fair Resource Allocation for D2D Communication.‚Äù  

The project focuses on simulating **Device-to-Device (D2D) communication** within a **single hexagonal cell**, modeling **resource allocation, path loss, and fast fading effects**. The simulation assumes **perfect channel state information (CSI)** at the receiver, ensuring accurate estimation of channel gains:  

- **g‚ÇñcB[n]** ‚Üí Channel gain between Cellular User (CU) and Base Station (B)  
- **g‚ÇñcdR[n]** ‚Üí Channel gain between CU and D2D Receiver (dR)  
- **g‚ÇñdTdR[n]** ‚Üí Channel gain between D2D Transmitter (dT) and D2D Receiver (dR)  
- **g‚ÇñdTB[n]** ‚Üí Channel gain between D2D Transmitter (dT) and Base Station (B)

## Simulation Procedure  
The simulation consists of **three major phases**:

1. **Resource Block (RB) Allocation to Cellular Users (CUs)**  
   - Assign RBs to CUs while maintaining fairness.  

2. **SNR Calculation and Power Allocation for D2D Users**  
   - Compute **SNR for each CU** and analyze **interference levels**.  
   - Determine optimal **power and rate allocation** for D2D users sharing the same RBs.  

3. **Optimal RB Selection for D2D Users**  
   - Calculate **achievable data rates** and select the best **RB-D2D pairs**.

## Data Generation & ETL Process  
A **Python script** was developed to **generate realistic data** for 5000 devices based on the above parameters. The data includes:  

‚úî **Distance** between devices  
‚úî **Path loss** calculations  
‚úî **Received power (dBm)**  
‚úî **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) (dB)**  
‚úî **Data rate (Mbps) based on Shannon Capacity formula**  
‚úî **Latency, Bandwidth, and other network metrics**  

The generated data underwent **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes** to clean, structure, and format the dataset for analysis in **Power BI**.

## Power BI Dashboard Creation üé®üìä  
The dashboard provides a **comprehensive visualization** of the **D2D communication system performance**. It includes:  

üìå **Path Loss ,bandwidth,datarate & SNR Analysis:**  
- Scatter plots  comparing **interference vs datarate and bandwidth**,**Impact on datarate as distance between devices increase etc.**



The dashboard allows users to **filter and analyze the impact of distance, interference, and latency on datarate** on overall network performance.
